<p align="justify"> 
 I'm an software engineer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my 2 years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I love working with a team.
 Before my current position, I was a junior programmer for web development. While working there, I committed to web system development, which has been my specialty for 2 years.
